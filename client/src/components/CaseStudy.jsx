      "1. Inefficient Order Sourcing: The evaluation and sourcing of dealer orders by the Product Group team was a manual, time-consuming process, often taking up to four days.\n" +
      "2. Rigid Legacy Systems: The in-house order management system was nearly 50 years old, with over 65% of its functionality unmodifiable, making new implementations and changes extremely challenging.\n" +
      "3. Resource-Intensive Configuration: Order fulfillment required the Variant Configuration team to manually set up material configurations in SAP, a process so labor-intensive it was projected to require over 60 additional full-time resources. This manual setup led to frequent errors and delays, impacting production schedules and delivery timelines. The complexity of product variations further exacerbated these issues, making scaling operations nearly impossible without significant human capital investment.",

      "3. Sales Configuration Management Application:\n" +
      "   - An application was built to allow the Variant Configuration team to upload and maintain configuration data directly within Salesforce.\n" +
